# mabl Bamboo Plugin

This plugin allows easy launching of [mabl](https://www.mabl.com) journeys as a step in your Bamboo build. Your Bamboo build success or failure will be dependant on the success or failure of your mabl test deployment event.

## Using
1. From any plan's 'Configre tasks' page, add a new task
2. Select the 'Mabl Deployment' task
3. Input the ApiKey and unselect the field, this will populate the Environment and Application drop-downs
4. Select at least 1 environment or application to proceed
4. Hit Save
5. Enable the task and the plan
